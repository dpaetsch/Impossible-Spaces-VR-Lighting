Version control for my Impossible-Spaces-VR-Lighting project.

This project is all about creating realistic lighting within impossible spaces. The reason this exists is because Unity's lighting system, while being quite advanced, is still limited to Euclidean spaces, in which light acts very similary to how it would in reality. 
In this project, lighting can work in impossible spaces, in which you might have overlapping rooms with accurate lighting.
